    "# Lecture 4: Working with OpenAI API and Reasoning Models\n",
    "\n",
    "### Overview\n",
    "\n",
    "And now comes the sun part!!! Let's get our hands dirty with calling the ChatGPT models using code.\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook demonstrates how to use the OpenAI API to create various AI-powered applications. We'll explore how to structure prompts, understand API responses, and evaluate model outputs using reasoning capabilities.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Objectives\n",
    "- Set up and configure the OpenAI API with proper authentication\n",
    "- Create effective prompts for different use cases\n",
    "- Process and display AI-generated responses\n",
    "- Compare standard chat models with reasoning models for evaluation tasks\n",
    "\n",
    "### Challenge\n",
    "Take the code we have used in this lecture and see if you can beat my overall score. Let's turn this into a friendly competition for all those tackling this project and compare the results you get :D\n",
    "\n",
    "Place your submission in the community-contributions folder by creating a folder with your name in it.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Version History\n",
    "\n",
    "Below you will find any updates I have made to the notebooks.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Please note** that some of the code may be different to what you have seen in the lectures as there may be bug fixes or improvements but the general objective of the notebook will remain the same.\n",
