    "# Lecture 7: Working with Claude API and Reasoning Models\n",
    "\n",
    "### Overview\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's finally dive into the nitty-gritty and see how we can code with Claude.\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook explores the Anthropic Claude API, focusing on how to leverage both standard chat capabilities and advanced reasoning features. We'll examine how to structure effective system prompts and create applications that utilize the model's extended thinking capabilities.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Objectives\n",
    "- Set up and configure the Anthropic Claude API\n",
    "- Create tailored system prompts for specific use cases\n",
    "- Compare standard responses with reasoning-enhanced outputs\n",
    "- Analyze the \"thinking\" process in reasoning models\n",
    "\n",
    "### Challenge\n",
    "Take the code we have used in this lecture and see if you can beat my overall score. Let's turn this into a friendly competition for all those tackling this project and compare the results you get :D\n",
    "\n",
    "Place your submission in the community-contributions folder by creating a folder with your name in it.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Version History\n",
    "\n",
    "Below you will find any updates I have made to the notebooks.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Please note** that some of the code may be different to what you have seen in the lectures as there may be bug fixes or improvements but the general objective of the notebook will remain the same.\n",
